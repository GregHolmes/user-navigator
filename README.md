# user-nav
## User Navigation Helper System done as a part of S6 Mini Project.

This project aims to help make the journey from a place to another more efficient and easier. The system collects various details about the locations (travel distance, nearby attractions, restaurants) from different APIs and displays all of it in a single place. It also uses the feedback of other users to display whether a particular area is of interest - be it a guttery road, or an accident-prone area. There is also a real-time chat available for users that are going to the same destination to communicate with each other. It also has a mini social network where the users can share events with their friends, the people they have added to their circles.
